                    Hey there! âœ‹ I'm Mahmoud, a self-taught software developer from Egypt. Currently, I work as a
                    Technical Lead at GamersLounge, where I help lead our developer experience and build innovative
                    solutions for our internal use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I come from an Android background, building both small and complex applications long before Kotlin
                    became a thing. Switching to the back-end was a strange coincidence, something I never really
                    planned for and I'm still not sure how it happened. Despite working as a full-time back-end
                    developer for quite some time now, I've always felt behind, as if I don't fully grasp the basic
                    concepts and never will be able to catch up. However, that hasn't stopped me from continuously
                    learning and trying to figure out the "right" way to do things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have always been passionate about tech. Ever since I got my first computer with an insane Pentium
                    II CPU and 512 MB of RAM ðŸ”¥, I fell in love with computers. Now, in my free time, you'll likely find
                    me glued to a screen, tinkering with some new technology, building these small useless tools that no
                    body asked for, or staring at my pile of unfinished projects ðŸ¤· I also enjoy playing survival games
                    and preparing for the zombie apocalypse.

        <div class="col-span-2">

            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-5">Why this blog?</h2>

            <div class="text-justify space-y-4">

                <p>
                    I created this blog to have a centralized place where I can freely express my thoughts, ideas, and
                    rants about all sorts of random topics. It's not just my personal corner of the internet,
                    but also an exploratory environment where I can learn and tinker with new
                    technologies, as well as share my learning journey.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In other words, it's more like a digital garden or a knowledge center if you will, where I cultivate
                    small, unfinished pieces of writing, guides, and snippets, gradually transforming them
                    into more polished and extensive articles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Writing has always been the most effective method to enhance my skills. Since I always have a
                    project or two in progress, many of which I work through by following guides and tutorials posted by
                    others, I often find myself rewriting and rearranging code snippets in a way that makes sense
                    to me and helps me grasp what's going on. This process requires thorough investigation and
                    additional research to ensure I've got everything right. However, it doesn't always work well,
                    which is why I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Pointing out my mistakes is an essential
                    part of my learning progress.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, in a way, this blog is me learning, exploring, and documenting my own progress with you.
                    Hopefully, in the future, it will also serve as my way to give back to the community.
                </p>
